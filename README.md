# Final-Project-Website

Page Purpose: The purpose of the page is an introduction to family and friends of shared memories at Lake Cushman

Information Sections: In these sections, I will outline the other pages for my timeline at Lake Cushman.

Content Grouping & Flow: In the main part of my website, I will describe different reasons that make Cushman special. 

Intentional List Usage: The list I have will highlight these topics. Unrelated topics would not work in this section.

Image with Intent: This picture shows the beauty of Cushman that we were lucky to experience.

Structural Reflection: I’m fairly confident with how I want the design to look. I would probably consider adding a history of Lake Cushman for added element. I would also like to add a “where are they” now section about our family.

Page Styling: I choose the background green to reflect the woods and the water idea for the site. The fonts, colors and spacing are based on required elements and what I thought worked well.

Heading and Paragraphs: I was trying to provide some contrasts with font color and spacing between elements.

Lists: The lists styling and spacing was really just experiment on my part, I haven't decided what I want to do with this yet.

Links: I changed the link colors because I think it works better with the current background. The hover effect lets views see that they are mousing over the links.

Images: This was again just experimenting on my part, just seeing what I could do.

Flexbox Layout Expansion:
    -What section did you focus on styling and why?
        I focused on adding images to the flexbox.
    -How did Flexbox change the layout of your content?
        I was able to highlight more photos of Lake Cushman from family photos.
    -One CSS rule you feel confident about:
        The layout of the photos.
    -One CSS rule that was confusing at first:
        Trying to figure out how to do the 'hover' effect.
