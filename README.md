# Final-Project-Website

Page Purpose: The purpose of the page is an introduction to family and friends of shared memories at Lake Cushman

Information Sections: In these sections, I will outline the other pages for my timeline at Lake Cushman.

Content Grouping & Flow: In the main part of my website, I will describe different reasons that make Cushman special. 

Intentional List Usage: The list I have will highlight these topics. Unrelated topics would not work in this section.

Image with Intent: This picture shows the beauty of Cushman that we were lucky to experience.

Structural Reflection: I’m fairly confident with how I want the design to look. I would probably consider adding a history of Lake Cushman for added element. I would also like to add a “where are they” now section about our family.
